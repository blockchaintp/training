title: Running the XO CLI
order: 6
---

## CLI Clients

The web UI is a one example of a client.  Another example is a CLI client.

These are command line applications that have the ability to:

 * load the current blockchain state for a set of addresses
 * submit new transactions which will be routed to transaction processors

> There is an XO client in the `code/xo/src/cli` folder

## Run xo cli client

Now we will play a game of XO using the CLI client.

You can exit the `shell` container you were just using by typing this:

```bash
exit
```

Then we get ourselves into the `xo-cli` utility container by typing this:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-xo-cli bash
```

Now we are inside the `xo-cli` container we run the CLI:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js
```

Because we didn't give it a command to run, it will display the following help output:

```bash
index.js <command>

Commands:
  index.js list                 List the current XO games
  index.js create <name>        Create a new XO game
  index.js show <name>          Display the current status of an XO game
  index.js take <name> <space>  Take a place in an existing XO game
  index.js delete <name>        Delete an existing XO game

Options:
  --version   Show version number                                      [boolean]
  --url       the url to connect to the rest api                      [required]
  --format    the format of the output (text, json)            [default: "text"]
  --key-dir   the directory to read the keys from
                                               [default: "/root/.sawtooth/keys"]
  --key-name  the name of the keys to use for submitting new transactions
                                                               [default: "root"]
  --help      Show help                                                [boolean]

Not enough non-option arguments: got 0, need at least 1
```

> This is the same output it would produce if we typed `./src/cli/index.js --help`

## --url argument

We will need to pass the `--url` flag to the XO client so it knows where to contact the rest-api.

> In a production environment - you would point this at a REST api endpoint that had some kind of authentication

## Create game

We can now use the CLI to create a new game:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js create my-cli-game --url http://rest-api:8008
```

Notice how it printed the id of the batch that was submitted to the transaction processor:

```bash
batch id: a161e5894d06948d0e5eee90f792b85528eb6f146e24ec95a6b3a86ec529aa56066cf1a8a724e6969ed22f59a5b5ee43e20c7756a8d1385b3f3635b9818ebb26
```

> Also notice how the transaction processor and validator both logged the transaction on it's way through

## --wait argument

Because Sawtooth is an eventually consistent system - submitting a transaction and getting the batch id doesn't mean it has been submitted to the chain.

There is the potential for the transaction to be rejected by the processor - all we know at this point is the id of the batch containing the transaction that was submitted.

Fortunately - the cli has a very useful flag called `--wait` - what this does is periodically poll the rest-api for the status of the batch that was just submitted until it enters either `COMMITTED` or `INVALID` status.

Only then will it print the results back to the terminal.

This means using the `--wait` flag you can be sure that when the results are returned, the transaction has either succeeded for failed.

Without the `--wait` flag - all we know is that the transaction was submitted to the validator and has not yet been send onwards to the transaction processor.

Let's create a game using the `--wait` flag:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js create my-cli-game2 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
batch id:             ec8f0e6810eb5c7ef2de4e4f829c0227f614e30f8f12400fc67907680cbec41b07a4afadd58ffe137c0d71ee24859ce742bae30aef477bdaf1013f8cb83961e3
status:               COMMITTED
```

Notice how this time, alongside the batch id, we get a `status` field of the output to confirm it has actually been committed.

## Failed transactions

What happens when the transaction processor rejects our transaction?

Let's give this a test by trying to make a game with a name that already exists:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js create my-cli-game2 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
batch id:             b04ef28f75c64539427ccdbd3d8a39fada237f28c5d013a671e9b3a3b6311db14c0ded69663c99083130384d5fd9188fe2e29d0e1e2eb42da496cb33dcc4a032
status:               INVALID
invalid transactions: 1

transaction id:       01d1a9a6db8739bebc34e624438c3aad90c79b3e40ec18038efb51074b6a82207e05103f1979d52aa46e9c3be147f6e18d300a86026381910f4b331200af63f8
message:              Invalid Action: Game already exists.
```

Notice how we now have output confirming that there were invalid transactions in the batch.

It also lists the transactions that were invalid along with a message telling you why the transaction was rejected (this comes direct from the transaction processor).

Now let's check the logs of the XO transaction processor.

First - exit the `xo-cli` utility container:

```bash
exit
```

Then view the logs:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-xo-tp
```

Notice the logs of the transaction processor - it should contain output like the following:

```bash
{ InvalidTransaction: Invalid Action: Game already exists.
    at state.getGame.then (/app/src/tp/handler.js:132:17)
    at <anonymous> name: 'InvalidTransaction' }
```

> When writing transaction processors - it is up to you to decide if a new transaction is valid or not based on the logic rules of your processor

## List games

Now we can list the games using the `list` subcommand.

First - lets get back into the `xo-cli` utility container:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-xo-cli bash
```

Then we can list the games:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js list --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
┌──────────────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────────┬─────────┐
│ GAME         │ PLAYER1 │ PLAYER2 │ BOARD     │ STATE   │
├──────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────────┼─────────┤
│ my-cli-game2 │         │         │ --------- │ P1-NEXT │
├──────────────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────────┼─────────┤
│ my-cli-game  │         │         │ --------- │ P1-NEXT │
└──────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────────┴─────────┘
```

> You might have more games in the list than this.

## JSON output

All of the XO cli commands can be told to produce their output in JSON format rather than human readable text.

This is useful if using a CLI client alongside other code.

Let's show the list of games in JSON format using the `--format json` argument:


```bash
./src/cli/index.js list --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

This should produce output like the following:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "my-cli-game2",
        "board": "---------",
        "state": "P1-NEXT",
        "player1": "",
        "player2": ""
    },
    {
        "name": "my-cli-game",
        "board": "---------",
        "state": "P1-NEXT",
        "player1": "",
        "player2": ""
    }
]
```

> You might have more games in the list than this

## Play game

Now we have a game called `my-cli-game` - we can submit a transaction that represents taking a space as a player.

This is done using the `take` subcommand.

Let's take the 3rd space in the `my-cli-game` game:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js take my-cli-game 3 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait
```

> Because the `take` command submits a transaction - we use the `--wait` argument to make sure it was successful


This should produce output like the following:

```bash
batch id:             0fd407fe5f320f8e389b989f0eb28fb088d83c78ba3994d570a08fccece46fd6209a6ebb4d9c95c0f9d0ff32e2aeea036fd6c4725ae057bbb4b8141685b88bc1
status:               COMMITTED
```

Let's try taking the same space again - hopefully, if the transaction processor is any good, it won't allow us to:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js take my-cli-game 3 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait
```

This time - it should show that the transaction was invalid:

```bash
batch id:             c7bd64fac590f4e012f658846ae7418b37407e440fb423f7292f53c6408cdf557189b9ec5d5ff307677f3e8453713ee2d408428204e1f4f7cb53b6e3f53a1d69
status:               INVALID
invalid transactions: 1

transaction id:       8e4a503ef29a8a1b098b7ff7c5b667b683e9fd18b45e2433647ebe0a714523cc40fe99f67072e285091a1dd391773dbd5de7c8dd40dae04b6a6939a5e76ddd36
message:              Invalid Action: Space already taken.
```

If you were to look at the logs of the transaction processor - you should be able to see that it's been busy processing these transactions - both the valid and rejected transaction.

First - exit the `xo-cli` utility container:

```bash
exit
```

Then show the logs:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-xo-tp
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
Player 0350bd takes space: 3
GAME:     my-cli-game
PLAYER 1: 0350bd
PLAYER 2:
STATE:    P2-NEXT

   |   | X
---|---|---
   |   |
---|---|---
   |   |
{ InvalidTransaction: Invalid Action: Space already taken.
    at state.getGame.then (/app/src/tp/handler.js:216:17)
    at <anonymous> name: 'InvalidTransaction' }
```

## Show game

The client is able to display a nice summary of a given game - let's look at the current state of the `my-cli-game` game.

First - get back into the `xo-cli` utility container:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-xo-cli bash
```

Then - we can list the games using this command:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js show my-cli-game --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should show output like the following:

```bash
GAME:     my-cli-game
PLAYER 1: 0350bd
PLAYER 2:
STATE:    P2-NEXT

   |   | X
---|---|---
   |   |
---|---|---
   |   |
```

## Generating different keys

At the moment - we are only playing using the default `root` keys for signing transactions.

You can see the effect of this by making another move in a different space:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js take my-cli-game 5 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait
```

Then showing the game:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js show my-cli-game --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should produce the following output:

```bash
GAME:     my-cli-game
PLAYER 1: 028385
PLAYER 2: 028385
STATE:    P1-NEXT

   |   | X
---|---|---
   | O |
---|---|---
   |   |
```

Notice how the keys for both player 1 and player 2 are the same key i.e. in this case: `028385`

> **NOTE** this is the default root key that the xo CLI uses if you don't provide a specific key to use

Building on what we learned earlier in the keys section - let's create a new set of keys for two players and use them to play.

First - exit the `xo-cli` utility container:

```bash
exit
```

Then let's get into the `shell` container:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-shell bash
```

Now - let's create a new set of keys for two users - `bob` and `alice`:

```bash
sawtooth keygen bob --force
sawtooth keygen alice --force
```

> We have mounted the key directory into both the shell container and the xo container - this means the keys we just created are present in both containers

## Playing with different keys

Now we have some keys - lets try playing a full game with them.

First - let's get back to the Docker host:

```bash
exit
```

Then let's get back to the `xo-cli` utility container:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-xo-cli bash
```

Let's check we have keys for both bob and alice:

```bash
ls -la /root/.sawtooth/keys
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
total 28
drwxr-xr-x    8 root     root           272 Nov 14 14:22 .
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root          4096 Nov 14 12:20 ..
-rw-r-----    1 root     root            65 Nov 14 14:22 alice.priv
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            67 Nov 14 14:22 alice.pub
-rw-r-----    1 root     root            65 Nov 14 14:22 bob.priv
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            67 Nov 14 14:22 bob.pub
-rw-r-----    1 root     root            65 Nov 14 12:21 root.priv
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            67 Nov 14 12:21 root.pub
```

Now let's create a new game, by default, transactions are signed using the `root` key:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js create alice-vs-bob --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait
```

We will use the `--key-name` argument to specify which keys we are going to submit transactions with.

First - let's submit a move as bob:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js take alice-vs-bob 5 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait --key-name bob
```

Then - let's submit a second move as alice:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js take alice-vs-bob 4 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait --key-name alice
```

Now - let's take a look at our game to see what is happening:

```bash
./src/cli/index.js show alice-vs-bob --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
GAME:     alice-vs-bob
PLAYER 1: 02150d
PLAYER 2: 039021
STATE:    P1-NEXT

   |   |
---|---|---
 O | X |
---|---|---
   |   |

```

Notice how the `PLAYER 1` and `PLAYER 2` values are now different.

Also notice how the current state of the game is `P1-NEXT`.

So - what would happen if we try to submit another move as alice?

```bash
./src/cli/index.js take alice-vs-bob 3 --url http://rest-api:8008 --wait --key-name alice
```

Well - because the state of the game is `P1-NEXT` but we tried to submit a new move as player 2 (alice) - the transaction is rejected:

```bash
batch id:             77b67edac9ab92b73220e95fa785c5a5bed2289c8d73a785cb08f39b63eb1fce126f3cf438297e49721c21121005e2be1290fd111ba038ad3330c30c85805058
status:               INVALID
invalid transactions: 1

transaction id:       62e8043908e1c061f459f35e389c84d40521ba7bba1146ca1fe00850b82aa9211251efd06a2f4819d643f044b9be963a48963a39c5aaf828bce87a0769977d47
message:              Not this players turn: 039021
```

Finally, let's exit the container:

```bash
exit
```

## advanced exercise

Open the browser UI (using the `8081` button) and play a game making one players moves in the browser and another players moves from the CLI.

Take a look through the CLI code in `code/xo/src/cli`
