title: Using the Sawtooth CLI tools
order: 7
---

So, we have created a bunch of state on the blockchain by playing various incarnations of XO!

The following section will deal with looking at a lower level, namely, the raw data on the blockchain itself.

There are various CLI tools that are useful to interact with a running sawtooth network.

Let's take some of these for a spin!

## REST API Endpoint

The various CLI tools we are about to use require access to the `rest-api` container over the network.

This was also true of the XO cli we were just using.

Because of the magic of Docker networking - this endpoint is available using the following address from any of the containers `http://rest-api:8008`

When using any of the following CLI commands - you must append the command with `--url http://rest-api:8008` so the command knows how to contact the REST api.

## `sawtooth` command

The shell container contains the `sawtooth` command which lets you interrogate the state of the blockchain in various ways.

## view transactions, batches and blocks

 * **list settings** (`sawtooth settings list`) - list the current settings of the sawtooth network
 * **list blocks** (`sawtooth block list`) - display a list of blocks that have been recorded on the chain
 * **view block** (`sawtooth block view <id>`) - view the details of a single block given it's id
 * **list batches** (`sawtooth batch list`) - display a list of transactions that have been recorded on the chain
 * **view batch** (`sawtooth batch view <id>`) - view the details of a single transaction given it's id
 * **list transactions** (`sawtooth transaction list`) - display a list of transactions that have been recorded on the chain
 * **view transaction** (`sawtooth transaction view <id>`) - view the details of a single transaction given it's id

In order to run any of these commands - you need to get into the `shell` container as follows:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-shell bash
```

> you might first need to exit the current container using the `exit` command

## list settings

We can check this using the `sawtooth settings list` command and point it at the `rest-api` container as follows:

```bash
sawtooth settings list --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

You should see output like the following:

```json
{
  "head": "7941bf58560ae5c3b9bbeff0f224f8474fe66a0902ceb96a074aa00adc4f243d6a9c772c579736417e81a69c69c6c3800912a9f401cca62dd48311cba00ff53e",
  "settings": {
    "sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys": "0371d36b084b73b94096a8faafed01eb8b2740b70243103d8b83a6e21ccd6f85af"
  }
}
```

This confirms that the rest-api is up and functioning and that we can interrogate the state of the Sawtooth network.

> note that we are using `--format json` in these commands.  You can choose from `{csv,json,yaml,default}` to suit your needs.

## list blocks

Transactions will have been submitted inside a `batch` which was included in a `block`.

Let's list the blocks using the `sawtooth block list` command - again pointing at the `rest-api` container:

```bash
sawtooth block list --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

This should produce output like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "batches": 1,
    "block_id": "f8609fe505ee6fe9ccaf0fd328becd7b006857b3f778b21c210603bf2786cca17d0620729eec322721155a97dcdc167cf74304ec14a2d3568972f68a1d0c5690",
    "num": "0",
    "signer": "03de1dc3ee8ab8cf3a721be3f8a4b7acbc3d729331ac85613133347626be362909",
    "txns": 1
  }
]
```

Let's dig into a block and see what it contains.

## show block

Copy the `block_id` value from the output of the `sawtooth block list` command above and assign it to a variable as follows:

```bash
export BLOCK_ID=f8609fe505ee6fe9ccaf0fd328becd7b006857b3f778b21c210603bf2786cca17d0620729eec322721155a97dcdc167cf74304ec14a2d3568972f68a1d0c5690
```

> make sure you have copied and replaced the block id from the output of the `sawtooth block list` command above - don't just use the command shown above because there will be no block with that specific id


Then - let's show that single block using the `sawtooth block show` command:

```bash
sawtooth block show $BLOCK_ID --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

You should see output like the following:

```json

}
```

> Notice how we have `batches` which contain some `transactions` inside a block.  This is the fundamental structure of sawtooth data.  Transactions are grouped into batches and blocks contain multiple batches.

## list batches

We can show a list of batches - ignoring the blocks they were included in, using the `sawtooth batch list` command as follows:

```bash
sawtooth batch list --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

You should get output like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "batch_id": "2b5b6d8bc2c3f07cdd3755b7c878b3a91bd8b52b501f35c465e4d176ef9ea2d258ce5fade99151a4d7b923012b3ed2b0d4a1266105ee6054d8525c54cb2da3e0",
    "signer": "030999907e2d10dda72810bae436646f58290d628a17f0c26b04578da658c525cb",
    "txns": 1
  }
]
```

> notice how the `batch_id` in the list is the same as the id in the block output above

## show batch

In the same way as you can display the details of a block, so you can do the same with a batch.

First - let's export the id of the batch from the above output.  Copy the `batch_id` from your output of the `sawtooth batch list` command and use the following command to export it:

```bash
export BATCH_ID=2b5b6d8bc2c3f07cdd3755b7c878b3a91bd8b52b501f35c465e4d176ef9ea2d258ce5fade99151a4d7b923012b3ed2b0d4a1266105ee6054d8525c54cb2da3e0
```

> Make sure to replace `BLOCK_ID` with the id you copied from your own output

Then we can use the `sawtooth batch show` command to view this single batch:

```bash
sawtooth batch show $BATCH_ID --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

You should see output like the following:

```json

    }
  ]
}
```

> notice how this output is a subset of the output from `sawtooth block show` - that's because blocks contain batches and we are looking at a single batch within a block now

## view batch status

To view the status of a batch - i.e. whether it was succesfully committed to a block or if it failed, you can use the `sawtooth batch status` command.

Let's look at the status of the settings update batch we are currently looking at:

```bash
sawtooth batch status $BATCH_ID --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

You should see (as expected) that the batch was succesfully committed to the blockchain by virtue of it's `COMMITTED` status:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "2b5b6d8bc2c3f07cdd3755b7c878b3a91bd8b52b501f35c465e4d176ef9ea2d258ce5fade99151a4d7b923012b3ed2b0d4a1266105ee6054d8525c54cb2da3e0",
    "invalid_transactions": [],
    "status": "COMMITTED"
  }
]
```

## list transactions

Finally, let's ignore batches and list the transactions using the `sawtooth transaction list` command.

```bash
sawtooth transaction list --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

You should see output like the following:

```json
[
  {
    "family": "sawtooth_settings",
    "payload": "CAESfgomc2F3dG9vdGguc2V0dGluZ3Mudm90ZS5hdXRob3JpemVkX2tleXMSQjAzMDk5OTkwN2UyZDEwZGRhNzI4MTBiYWU0MzY2NDZmNTgyOTBkNjI4YTE3ZjBjMjZiMDQ1NzhkYTY1OGM1MjVjYhoQMTU0MjExNzY2My41ODI2Mg==",
    "size": 130,
    "transaction_id": "df6904d244984295dfb6dc2405c619a45416e5998dd9a6483cab0c37b4fd888e589c5afbc16ba02232619f41ae738d6b6d9fbe26f2acb7969b6484cbbd489b88",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
]
```

> note how the `family` of this transaction was `sawtooth_settings` - that means the transaction processor that this transaction targeted was the settings tp.  When you start writing transaction processors of your own, transactions you submit to it will use the `family` of the transaction processor you are writing.

## show transaction

Let's look at the detail for that transaction using the `sawtooth transaction show` command.

First - copy the `transaction_id` field from the above output and export it:

```bash
export TRANSACTION_ID=df6904d244984295dfb6dc2405c619a45416e5998dd9a6483cab0c37b4fd888e589c5afbc16ba02232619f41ae738d6b6d9fbe26f2acb7969b6484cbbd489b88
```

Then - let's look at the detail of the single transaction:

```bash
sawtooth transaction show $TRANSACTION_ID --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

You should see output like the following:

```json

}
```

## list state

Blocks, batches and transactions represent the chain of mutations leading up to this point.

Let's look at the data as it is right now on the chain.

To do this we use the `sawtooth state list` command:

```bash
sawtooth state list --url http://rest-api:8008 --format json
```

This should show that there is a single item of state and your output should look like:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "address": "000000a87cb5eafdcca6a8cde0fb0dec1400c5ab274474a6aa82c12840f169a04216b7",

  "head": "f8609fe505ee6fe9ccaf0fd328becd7b006857b3f778b21c210603bf2786cca17d0620729eec322721155a97dcdc167cf74304ec14a2d3568972f68a1d0c5690"

## show state

To view a single item of state - copy the `address` field of the output from `sawtooth state list` and export it:

```bash
export STATE_ADDRESS=000000a87cb5eafdcca6a8cde0fb0dec1400c5ab274474a6aa82c12840f169a04216b7
```

Now we can use the `sawtooth state show` command to look at that state:

```bash
sawtooth state show $STATE_ADDRESS --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should give you output like the following:

```bash
DATA: "b'\nl\n&sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys\x12B030999907e2d10dda72810bae436646f58290d628a17f0c26b04578da658c525cb'"
HEAD: "f8609fe505ee6fe9ccaf0fd328becd7b006857b3f778b21c210603bf2786cca17d0620729eec322721155a97dcdc167cf74304ec14a2d3568972f68a1d0c5690"
```

## advanced exercise

Take a look at the [CLI reference](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.5/cli.html) and get to know the full range of CLI commands.

Use the [identity command](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.5/cli/sawtooth.html#sawtooth-identity) to create a new `role` and `policy`.
